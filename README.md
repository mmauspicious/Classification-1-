**Problem Statement**

**Proton Collision**

As we learned in high school, atoms—though minuscule—are composed of even smaller constituents known as subatomic particles: protons, electrons, and neutrons. Protons and neutrons form the atomic nucleus, while electrons orbit around it.

During proton collisions, the quarks and gluons within the interacting protons engage in complex interactions, resulting in a wide array of low-energy particles. Occasionally, these collisions yield heavier particles or produce energetic particle–antiparticle pairs, and sometimes entirely new particles emerge [1].

Protons themselves consist of elementary particles called quarks, which are bound together by gluons. Each proton comprises three quarks and is held together by streams of gluons.

When two protons approach closely, they interact through forces mediated by exchange particles, a hallmark of subatomic behavior. Unlike everyday collisions—such as car accidents—these high-speed interactions occur at velocities near the speed of light, within the quantum realm where energy can transform directly into matter. In these events, a newly created particle may exist only for a fleeting moment before decaying into other particles that are then detected in laboratory experiments.

Thus, the original constituents transform into a cascade of different particles, rendering the initial state unrecognizable. This behavior is characteristic of the quantum world, which operates under scales and principles distinct from those of classical physics. In particle physics, conservation laws—such as those governing energy, momentum, and other quantum numbers—are paramount. As long as these conserved quantities remain balanced between the initial and final states, the collision adheres to the fundamental laws of nature.
